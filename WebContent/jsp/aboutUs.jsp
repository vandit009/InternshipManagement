Vraj Bhagirathi Charitable Trust (VBCT) lead by Pujya Bhaishri was established in year 1994 to promote education in rural areas. VBCT earlier constructed a primary school in Devka in year 2003 which is presently being run by the Government.
Bhaishri believes "Vidyaamrutmashnuate" i.e. through education one can have all happiness in life. He also believes that an educated person is a valuable asset to the society as he can contribute to the development of the nation. True to his belief Sandipani Vidyaniketan in Porbandar stands as a testimony to his commitment to promoting education. 
Numerous individuals and oragnisations have pledged their support to the Devka Vidyapeeth project which is currently underway.

The Devka Vidyapeeth will be spread over 20 acres of land with modern infrastructure and facilities with a capacity of over 1200 children and state of the art facilities to give children of Devka and of the nearby villages the opportunity to pursue primary, secondary and college level education.
